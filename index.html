        <p>
          AI systems increasingly influence decisions in regulated, safety-critical, and institutional environments. When those
          decisions are reviewed, the underlying infrastructure often produces telemetry, logs, and traces that were never designed
          to function as durable evidence.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Telemetry describes activity.<br>It does not preserve proof.</strong></p>

        <p>NADIR exists to address that structural gap.</p>

        <p>
          NADIR is a decoupled evidentiary layer that attaches beside inference systems and produces policy-scoped, canonical artifacts
          representing defined inference-time decision-state context. These artifacts are deterministically structured and cryptographically
          sealed to support later institutional verification without default disclosure of proprietary internals.
        </p>

        <p><strong>NADIR does not evaluate outputs.<br>NADIR does not adjudicate compliance.<br>NADIR produces records.</strong></p>

      </div>

      <div class="focusable">
        <p>
          Modern AI deployments optimize for throughput, latency, and availability. Accountability infrastructure is frequently secondary.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a decision is later questioned—through regulatory inquiry, internal audit, incident review, or litigation—organizations often
          reconstruct events from partial logs and distributed traces. Reconstruction is interpretive. It is not deterministic.
        </p>

        <p>Institutions require more than reconstructed context. They require artifacts that are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Canonical in structure</li>
          <li>Explicit in capture scope</li>
          <li>Cryptographically sealed</li>
          <li>Independently verifiable</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Without those properties, oversight depends on operator assertions rather than verifiable integrity.
        </p>

        <p><strong>This is an architectural deficit, not an operational oversight.</strong></p>

        <p>
          It captures only what policy defines, normalizes that context into a stable artifact schema, applies deterministic
          canonicalization, and seals the artifact for tamper-evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Verification confirms integrity and provenance under declared policy scope. It does not confirm correctness of output.
        </p>

        <p>
          This separation is deliberate. Evidence infrastructure must remain structurally independent from decision authority.

          NADIR artifacts are structured to enable tiered disclosure. Integrity may be validated without revealing internal mechanics
          beyond policy scope.
        </p>

        <p>
          Policy defines inclusion, exclusion, and masking rules before artifact generation. Disclosure boundaries are explicit rather than implied.

  <p class="kicker">CAPTURE BOUNDARY • ARTIFACT SCHEMA • INTEGRITY • DISCLOSURE • VERIFICATION</p>
  <h1>ARCHITECTURE</h1>

  <p>
    NADIR follows a strict mechanics chain: attach at the inference boundary, generate a canonical artifact schema,
    seal it with integrity controls, enforce controlled disclosure, and enable independent verification.
  </p>

  <!-- STAGE 1 -->
  <section class="stage">
    <h2>STAGE 1 — CAPTURE MODEL</h2>

    <p>
      NADIR is designed to attach non-intrusively at the inference boundary (sidecar, gateway, or wrapper).
      Capture scope is policy-defined and explicitly bounded to avoid unnecessary collection and to preserve
      confidential implementation boundaries.
    </p>

    <h3>Inference boundary attachment</h3>
    <p>
      Instrumentation point is outside core model logic to reduce adoption friction and avoid mutating weights.
    </p>

    <h3>Policy-scoped capture</h3>
    <p>
      Capture includes defined inputs and runtime context; excludes proprietary weights,
      architecture details, and unrelated data.
    </p>

    <h3>Mandatory fail-open architecture</h3>
    <p>
      If the sealing layer encounters a failure condition, NADIR does not interrupt inference.
      The primary system continues operating. A fail-open exception is logged and the unsealed
      event is flagged for review. System availability is never compromised by the artifact layer.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STAGE 2 -->
  <section class="stage">
    <h2>STAGE 2 — ARTIFACT SCHEMA</h2>

    <p>
      Captured context is normalized into a canonical artifact structure intended to support
      integrity verification under defined capture conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Timestamp · Provenance metadata · Input hash · Policy ID · Policy version · Policy hash ·
      Capture environment fingerprint · Canonicalization version · Disclosure tier · Integrity fields · Verification fields
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STAGE 3 -->
  <section class="stage">
    <h2>STAGE 3 — INTEGRITY MODEL</h2>

    <p>
      Artifacts are sealed using cryptographic hashing and digital signatures to support
      authenticity validation and tamper detection.
      Default reference implementations may include SHA-256 for hashing and ECDSA (e.g., P-256) for digital signatures.
      Canonicalization conforms to RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme) — the sole normative
      serialization method applied to artifact content prior to hashing.
      Deployment-specific cryptographic suites may vary based on regulatory or operational requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>Hashing</h3>
    <p>Produces a fixed digest of the canonical artifact to detect modification.</p>

    <h3>Digital signature</h3>
    <p>Authenticates artifact origin under key custody and verification policies.</p>

    <h3>Time anchoring</h3>
    <p>
      Supports evidentiary posture by binding artifact integrity to trusted timestamp authorities (TSA),
      hardware security module–based time sources, or cryptographically verifiable time attestation mechanisms.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STAGE 4 -->
  <section class="stage">
    <h2>STAGE 4 — DISCLOSURE FIELD MODEL</h2>

    <p>
      NADIR supports tiered visibility: reviewers verify integrity and provenance without receiving proprietary internals.
      Disclosure boundaries are policy-defined.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STAGE 5 -->
  <section class="stage">
    <h2>STAGE 5 — VERIFICATION WORKFLOW</h2>

    <p>
      Verification is performed by recomputing hashes over the canonical artifact,
      validating signatures, and confirming policy alignment.
      Verification confirms artifact integrity and provenance — not inference reproducibility or decision correctness.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>BOUNDARY DECLARATION</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NADIR verifies artifact integrity and provenance under policy.</li>
      <li>NADIR does not certify compliance, legality, or model correctness.</li>
      <li>NADIR does not guarantee inference reproducibility.</li>
      <li>NADIR does not assume operational control over inference infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Oversight conclusions are made by authorized institutions and operators.</li>
    </ul>
